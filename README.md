# 🛕 Heritage 3D

**Heritage 3D** is a Generative AI-powered platform designed to **preserve and educate** about India's rich cultural heritage. From the majestic ruins of **Hampi** to the intricate carvings of **Konark**, many ancient sites are at risk of decay and neglect. This project brings them to life through AI-generated 3D models, refined and presented in an interactive, accessible format.

## 🌟 Features

### 🎨 Text-to-3D Generation
- Generate base 3D meshes from **text prompts** or **image inputs** using a custom AI model.

### 🛠️ Model Refinement
- Auto-smooth, texture, and light the models using:
  - `bpy` (Blender Python)
  - `trimesh`
  - `.jpg` textures from Google Drive

### 🌐 Web Platform
- Built using **Streamlit** or **Google Colab**
- Explore 3D models with:
  - Real-time interactive view (`plotly`)
  - **Multilingual annotations** (English & Hindi)
  - **Virtual tours** for immersive learning

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Prompt or Upload**  
   → Provide a text description or image of a heritage site.

2. **AI Model Generates 3D Mesh**  
   → A base mesh is created resembling the temple/structure.

3. **Refinement & Texturing**  
   → Blender scripts apply smoothing, textures, and lighting.

4. **Explore on Web App**  
   → Models are visualized with annotations & tours.
